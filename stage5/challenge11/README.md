## About the challenge

For this challenge we'll build the mobile version of our app - Gympoint - for the back-end built throughout modules 03 and 04 of Node.js and front-end built throughout module 10 of ReactJS.

Gympoint Mobile represents the students side, this is, all the features available in this project are meant to be used by students.
