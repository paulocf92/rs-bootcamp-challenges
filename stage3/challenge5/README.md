# Challenge 5

## Description

Create an app from scratch using Webpack, Babel, Webpack Dev Server and ReactJS.

For this application we'll develop an interface similar to Facebook using React.

The information displayed on the interface are static and don't need to reflect any REST API or back-end data.

### Components

This interface will feature a few components:

**Header:** Displays Facebook logo and a link to user profile;

**PostList:** Stores post list data. This data must be stored in this component's state instead of a plain variable.

**Post:** Displays post data. This data is passed by PostList component through a property.

**Comment:** Displays a comment. This data is passed by Post component through a property. The Post component will have list of comments through which it will iterate.
